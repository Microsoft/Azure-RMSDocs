# Quick start tutorial for Azure Information Protection 

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection*

Use this tutorial to quickly try out Azure Information Protection with just 5 steps that should take you about 30 minutes. This tutorial is designed to be a self-guided demo to quickly show case some of the features and functionality that Azure Information Protection offers. It does not include all the available features and is not intended to be a deployment guide for your organization. If you are looking to deploy Azure Information Protection for your organization, see the [deployment roadmap documentation](../plan-design/deployment-roadmap.md). 

This tutorial is intended for IT administrators and consultants, to help them evaluate Azure Information Protection as an enterprise information protection solution for an organization. In a production environment, the steps to configure the Information Protection policy, and install the client and application for users would be done by an administrator. The steps to label the document and safely share a document by email and track it would done by end users. This tutorial includes all these steps, to demonstrate typical end-to-end scenarios of classifying, labeling, and protecting your organization's data.

## Prerequisites 
To complete this tutorial, you will need the following things:

- A subscription that includes Azure Information Protection for classification, labeling, and protection. This tutorial includes some of the advanced features, such as automated data classification with user recommendations, and the document tracking site. Make sure that your subscription supports these features. For more information, see the [subscription information](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/azure-information-protection-pricing) and [feature list](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/azure-information-protection-features) from the Azure Information Protection site.
    
    If you don't have a subscription for these features, you can sign up for a free trial for [Enterprise Mobility + Security E5](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=87dd2714-d452-48a0-a809-d2f58c4f68b7).
    
- A subscription for Azure, so you can access the Azure portal, to configure the Azure Information Protection policy. If you do not already have an Azure subscription for your organization, you can get one by signing up for a free trial: Go to the [Azure Get started page](https://account.windowsazure.com/organization) and follow the instructions.

  > [!TIP] 
  > If you need to get one or more of these subscriptions, do this in advance because this process can sometimes take a while to complete.

- A global administrator account to sign in to the Azure portal to configure the Azure Information Protection policy. This account must also have an email address and a working email service (for example, Exchange Online or Exchange Server).
