# Applications that support Azure Rights Management data protection

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection, Office 365*


Use the following tables to identify the applications and solutions that natively support the Azure Rights Management service (Azure RMS), which provides the data protection for Azure Information Protection. 

For these applications and solutions, Rights Management support is tightly integrated by using the Rights Management APIs to support usage restrictions. These applications and solutions are also known as "RMS-enlightened".

Unless stated otherwise, the supported capabilities apply to both Azure RMS and AD RMS. In addition, AD RMS support on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows Phone 8.1 requires [Active Directory Rights Management Services Mobile Device Extension](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn673574.aspx).

## RMS-enlightened applications

The following table displays RMS-enlightened client applications from Microsoft and software vendors.

Information about the table columns:

-   **Protected PDF**: These files can have a .pdf or .ppdf file name extension.

-   **Email:** The email clients listed can protect the email message itself, which will automatically protect any attached Office files that are not already protected. In this scenario, the client’s preview feature can display the protected content (message and attachment) to authorized recipients. However, if an email message itself is not protected but the attachment is protected, the client’s preview feature cannot display the protected attachment to authorized recipients.

-   **Other file types**: Text and image files include files that have a file name extension such as .txt, .xml, .jpg, .and jpeg. These files change their file name extension after they are natively protected by Rights Management, and become read-only. Files that cannot be natively protected have a .pfile file name extension after they are generically protected by Rights Management. For more information, see the [File types supported](../rms-client/client-admin-guide-file-types.md) from the Azure Information Protection client admin guide.

###### Footnote 1
Supports viewing protected content.

###### Footnote 2 
Supports viewing protected documents when an unprotected document is uploaded to a protected library in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. 

###### Footnote 3
If a recipient receives a protected email and is not using Exchange as the mail server or if the sender belongs to another organization, this content can be opened only in a rich email client, such as Outlook. This content cannot be opened from Outlook Web Access.

###### Footnote 4
Uses Exchange ActiveSync IRM, which must be enabled by the Exchange administrator. Users can view, reply, and reply all for protected email messages but users cannot protect new email messages themselves.

If a recipient receives a protected email and is not using Exchange as the mail server or if the sender belongs to another organization, this content can be opened only in a rich email client, such as Outlook. This content cannot be opened from Outlook Web Access or from mobile mail clients using Exchange Active Sync IRM.

###### Footnote 5
Supports viewing and editing protected documents for iOS. For more information, see the following post on the Office blog: [Azure Rights Management support comes to Office for iPad and iPhone](https://blogs.office.com/2015/07/22/azure-rights-management-support-comes-to-office-for-ipad-and-iphone-2/)

### More information about Azure RMS support for Office

Azure RMS is tightly integrated into the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook apps, where this functionality is often referred to as Information Rights Management (IRM). The following Office client editions support protecting files and emails by using Azure RMS:

- Office 365 ProPlus: Office 2016 and Office 2013

- Office Professional Plus 2016

- Office Professional Plus 2013

- Office Professional Plus 2010

All editions of Office (with the exception of Office 2007) support consuming protected content.

Azure RMS with Office Professional Plus 2010 or Office Professional 2010:

- Requires the Azure Information Protection client for Windows or the Rights Management sharing application for Windows

- Not supported on Windows 10

- Does not support forms-based authentication for federated user accounts. These accounts must use Windows Integrated Authentication.

### More information about the Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android

The Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android replaces the RMS sharing app for these devices. It provides the same functionality and in addition, supports rights-protected email messages and rights-protected PDF files on SharePoint Online.

If your iOS and Android devices are enrolled by Microsoft Intune, you can deploy and manage this app by using a policy managed app. For more information, see [Configure and deploy mobile application management policies in the Microsoft Intune console](/intune/deploy-use/configure-and-deploy-mobile-application-management-policies-in-the-microsoft-intune-console) from the Intune documentation. For Step 2 from this Intune documentation, use the instructions to publish a policy managed app.

For more information, see the [FAQ for Microsoft Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android](../rms-client/mobile-app-faq.md).


### More information about the Azure Information Protection client for Windows

This client now replaces the Rights Management sharing application for Windows. 

For more information, see the following resources:

- [Azure Information Protection client administrator guide](../rms-client/client-admin-guide.md)

- [Azure Information Protection client user guide](../rms-client/client-user-guide.md)

- [FAQs for Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android](../rms-client/mobile-app-faq.md)

Download the relevant app by using the links on the [Microsoft Azure Information Protection page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=303970).

### More information about the Rights Management sharing application

This application is being replaced by the Azure Information Protection client. It is still required for Mac computers and Windows Phone mobile devices. 

For more information, see the following resources:

-   [Rights Management sharing application administrator guide](../rms-client/sharing-app-admin-guide.md)

-   [Rights Management sharing application user guide](../rms-client/sharing-app-user-guide.md)

-   [FAQ for Microsoft Rights Management Sharing Application for Mobile Platforms](https://technet.microsoft.com/dn451248)

Download the app for Mac computers and for Windows Phone using the links on the [Microsoft Azure Information Protection page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=303970).


### More information about other applications that support Azure Information Protection

In addition to the applications in the table, any application that supports the APIs for the Azure Rights Management service can be integrated with Azure Information Protection, which includes:

- Line-of-business applications that are written in-house by using the RMS SDKs

- Applications from software vendors that are written by using the RMS SDKs.

For more information, see the [Azure Information Protection Developer's Guide](../develop/developers-guide.md).

### Applications that are not supported by Azure RMS

The following applications that are not currently supported by Azure RMS include the following:

-   Microsoft Office for Mac 2011

-   Microsoft OneDrive for Business for SharePoint Server 2013

-   XPS Viewer
 
In addition, the RMS sharing application and the Azure Information Protection client has the following restrictions:

-   For Windows computers: Requires a minimum version of Windows 7 Service Pack 1
