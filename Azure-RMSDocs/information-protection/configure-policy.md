# Configuring Azure Information Protection policy

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection preview*

**[ This information is preliminary and subject to change. During the preview, blank articles might be published as placeholders. ]**

To configure classification, labeling, and protection, you must configure the Azure Information Protection policy. This policy is then downloaded to computers that have installed the [Azure Information Protection client](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53018).

To configure the Azure Information Protection policy during the preview release of Azure Information Protection:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. On the hub menu, click **Browse** and start typing **Information Protection** in the Filter box. From the results, select **Azure Information Protection**. 

    You'll then see the **Azure Information Protection** blade where you can configure the Azure Information Protection policy, which contains the following elements:

    - Title and tooltip for the Information Protection bar that users see in their Office applications.

    - Labels that let you and users classify documents and emails.

    - The option to enforce classification when users save documents and send emails.

    - The option to set a default label as a starting point for classifying documents and emails.

    - The option to prompt users to provide a reason when they select a label that has a lower sensitivity level than the original.


Azure Information Protection comes with a [default policy](configure-policy-default.md), which contains the labels **Personal**, **Public**, **Internal**, **Confidential**, and **Secret**. You can use the default labels without changes, or you can customize them, or you can delete them, and you can create new labels.

When you make any changes on an Azure Information Protection blade, click **Save** to save the changes, or click **Discard** to revert to the last saved settings. 

When you have finished making the changes that you want, click **Publish**. 

The Azure Information Protection client checks for any changes whenever a supported Office application starts, and downloads the changes as its Azure Information Protection policy.
