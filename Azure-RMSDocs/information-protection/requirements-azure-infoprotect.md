**[ This information is preliminary and subject to change. During the preview, blank articles might be published as placeholders. ]**

To evaluate the preview release of Azure Information Protection, make sure that you have the following prerequisites. 

|Requirement|More information|
|---------------|--------------------|
|A cloud subscription that includes Azure RMS|Your organization must have a cloud subscription that supports Rights Management.<br /><br />For more information and links to free trials, see [Cloud subscriptions that support Azure RMS](../get-started/requirements-subscriptions.md).|
|Azure AD directory|Your organization must have an Azure AD directory to support user authentication for Azure RMS and Azure Information Protection. In addition, if you want to use your user accounts from your on-premises directory (AD DS), you must also configure directory integration.<br /><br />Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is supported with Azure RMS when you have the required client software and correctly configured MFA supporting infrastructure.<br /><br />For more information, see [Azure AD directory](../get-started/requirements-azure-ad.md), where the information for Azure RMS also applies to Azure Information Protection.|
